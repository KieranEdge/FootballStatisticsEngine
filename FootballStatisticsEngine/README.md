#Football Statistics Engine
Welcome to the main project of the football statistics engine.

## Setting up connection strings
To use the engine you will need to either:
* Add the database connection string to an environment value called FOOTBALL_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING (*Recommended*)
* Modify the connection string in the App.config file


The first option can be performed in cmd on Windows by running the command.
```
setx FOOTBALL_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING "{Your_Connection_String}"
```
